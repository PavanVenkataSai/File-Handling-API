where we have the whole code base indexed and created the embedding for it using some specialized embedding models. So which are those specialized embedding models? There are some embedding models specialized for the code. There are different sizes as well.
Why we will use some sizes and some not. If you are using heavy model it will use API code and cannot run inside the VS Code extension environment. So there are some problems in that as well. So we have to use some models to run the code. So we have to use some models to run the code. So we have to use some models to run the code. So we have to use some models to run the code. So we have to use some models to run the code. So we have to use some models to run the code. So we have to use some models to run the code. So we have to use some models to run the code.
So we have to use some models to run the code. So we have to use some models to run the code. So we have to use some models to run the code. So we have to use some models to run the code. So we have to use some models to run the code. So we have to use some models to run the code. and cannot run inside the VS Code extension environment. There are some problems with that as well. So we need to use smart and fine tuned model for creating embedding.
Some of the chunking technique also required. We don't want our chunks to be overlapping or some irrelevant chunks need not to be there. Because whenever you are sending those chunks to context for the model. It will be that
Half of the in middle para we should not chunk It's not a para, it's basically the code It can be bigger code graph or smaller code graph embedding
Smart embedding. That is one representation of the representation of code base as well. So I'm telling you these things Another representation like some summarization of code base.
You said the graph representation, that is also one thing you can use that. But on monday we don't want this, not so answer, not, definitely not. We need some in-depth answer like which database they use, how, what are the techniques for that, how exactly will you do, which library will you use. These things, like these are needed. And that's, it is the implementation needed these are the details this is the implementation details
because you will be the engineer to implement those things along with other software engineers so that is one thing we want then we get, so after the retriever
we need to rewrite those retrievers and we need to remove some of them so rewriting them bases on certain parameters which is again the grounding parameter and then the query like translated query different explorations so based on that the re-ranking happens after that we will send it to the main model this again uses agentic workflow so that whenever it needs a full file code like
you can want to read the full file it will ask for the full file internally in the agentic workflow and then if you want to generate the code it will generate code for certain file and you need to apply it automatically those things are agentic workflow that is being done at some of the same page right that is what we want

like making code base understanding as good as agreement okay that is the thing why we cannot use or why we cannot you know attach the whole code base into a retrieval mechanism like a simple embedding retrieval and then we can ask okay now this is a good translated query
to search the relevant of why we cannot do that and what is the problem with that like meetup copilot is coming uh facing the backlash and other coding copilots are getting a button because of these techniques only nothing with the marketing nothing with the money that they don't have everything is like they have everything probably these things like retriever and other stuff okay so i need you to go through this as much as each and every step okay multiple representations what other representations
can help now how you can you know connect these multiple representations with each other now if there is a way so that the retriever you might so whenever you're doing retrieving retriever you understood okay these are the chunks and you want all the relevant chunks for that like all the relevant dependencies the gap would help but they need to be intergrated somehow right so this is what you need to research about and then vary in that meeting will do in the monday like on monday uh and we can give you some of the resources that we can write now there is one sorry, can I take my notes?
the resources are, let's say, yes, there is one, so all the open source repositories are open source similar projects that we have delivered, one is continue dev continue dev, then we have cloud dev
continue dev, cloud dev, continue dev, cloud dev and then we have aider, aider AIDER, AIDER, AIDER, AIDER, AIDER, AIDER, AIDER, AIDER, AIDER, AIDER, AIDER, AIDER, AIDER, AIDER, and then we have some Cursor AI, Cursor AI, Github Copilot is already there, Cursor AI
is in Code Editor, yes, it's another code for Fios code, they implemented some AI features there, some other blogs, like they, these companies have certain blogs as well, you and understand about that. We have Codium.
C-O-D-U-I-U-M Codium. There is one more not Codium that was Super Mavin. Super Mavin. They have built their own bedroom.
Great model for auto-condition which has lightning speed and it can accommodate the whole 4 bed into a single context window. That is what they have achieved. So it's interesting and they have some blogs as well now they are building the code editor as well synthetic pump reader so you read about that as well there is another uh These are the companies like zed editior and you can, so there are some companies who make just re-ranking models, there are some companies who just make embedding models. Okay, so do some research and let's talk on Monday.
Sure. Thank you so much. It is great learning for me as well. It will be great learning for us as well on Monday. You should do your research. Sure. So putting my breath and time on you. Sure, sure. You will be sent.

[03:45] money that they don't have everything is like they have everything probably these things like retriever and other stuff okay so i need you to go through this and that's how we can go for each and every step okay multiple representations what other representations
[04:04] can help now how you can you know connect these multiple representations with each other now if there is a way so that the retriever you might so whenever you're doing retrieving retriever you understood okay these are the chunks and you want all the relevant chunks for that like
[04:21] all the relevant dependencies the gap would help but they need to be interconnected somehow right so this is what you need to research about and then vary in that meeting will do in the monday like on monday uh and you can listen and share okay sure and you can sort of mail on the
[04:45] same thread uh the meeting thread if you need any if you have any questions sure okay so we can give you some of the resources that we can write now there is one sorry, can I take my notes?

[06:54] editor as well synthetic pump reader so you read about that as well there is another uh These are the companies and you can, so there are some companies who make just re-ranking models, there are some companies who just make competing models. Okay, so do some research and let's talk on Monday.
[07:38] Sure. Thank you so much. It is great learning for me as well. It will be great learning for us as well on Monday. You should do your research. Sure. So putting my breath and time on you. Sure, sure. You will be sent.
[08:02] Sure. Okay. Sure. Thank you. Thank you. sure sure sure sure thank you thank you thank you so much great great connecting to it so nj will be naren will be connecting with the respective time right when to connect uh you can
[08:21] you can yeah you can reply on whether you have hit that okay and then in general you decide whether sure on the on in this mail you're asking me to reply in this mail yeah the mail You are asking me to reply in this mail?
